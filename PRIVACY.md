This plugin for Dify ("the plugin") provides an interface to the Lakera Guard API, **a product of Check Point Software Technologies**. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy outlines how we handle your data.

## Data We Handle

The plugin processes the following data:

3.  **Configuration Parameters**: Optional parameters you provide, such as `project_id` or `metadata`.

## How We Use Your Data

Your data is used exclusively for the following purposes:

*   The **API Key** is transmitted directly to the Lakera Guard API for authentication and is not stored by the plugin.
*   The **Text for Analysis** and **Configuration Parameters** are sent directly to the Lakera Guard API to perform the security screening you requested.

## Data Storage and Sharing

*   **No Data Storage**: The plugin **does not store** any of your data, including your API key or the content you submit.
*   **Secure Credential Handling**: Your Lakera Guard API Key is stored and managed securely by the Dify platform, not by this plugin.
